University of Colorado, Boulder DTSA 5510 Final Project for Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning

This project uses a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinrustam/wine-dataset?select=WineDataset.csv) that includes a variety of wine characteristics, such as region, cost, grape type, etc. The goal of this project is to use Unsupervised Learning methods to create clusters of different wines, which can then be used to make new wine recommendations.
